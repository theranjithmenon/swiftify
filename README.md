Swiftify brings the simplicity and elegance of SwiftUI's modifier-style syntax to Flutter! With Swiftify, you can create beautiful UIs with cleaner and more readable code by using chainable, declarative methods to modify widgets.
## Features

SwiftUI-like Modifiers: Apply common widget properties (e.g., padding, textstyles etc) with intuitive .modifier() methods.
Chainable Methods: Combine multiple modifications into a single statement for a clean and declarative style.
Cleaner Codebase: Reduce widget nesting and improve code readability.
Support for Common Widgets: Includes extensions for Text and more.

```dart
Text("Hello, Flutter!")
    .padding()
    .center()
    .backgroundColor(Colors.blue);
Image.asset('assets/person.png')
    .respectSafeArea()
```
